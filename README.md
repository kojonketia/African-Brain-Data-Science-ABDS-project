# African-Brain-Data-Science-ABDS-project
A mini project about the comparison of certain brain volumes, which are total brain volume, intracranial volume, gray matter volume and white matter volume, collected from individuals as part of the larger Cam-CAN brain study. I collaborated with Abdulrahmon A. Olagunju on this project

## Data repository
From the Cam-CAN dataset at Brainlife.io (https://brainlife.io/) 

## Methods
This is a secondary analysis of de-identified data collected within a larger brain study. The data constitute 30 individuals of 15 males and 15 females grouped into young (18-30 years) and old (70-87 years) from the Brainlife dataset repositiory. These areas are the total brain volume, intracranial volume, gray matter volume and white matter volume.

To assess the difference between the data obtained from participants in the Brainlife Cam-CAN data repository, we employed two statistical tests: the T-test and the Mann Whitney U test. The T-test is utilized when both data groups pass the normality test, which is initially conducted using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Conversely, if the data fails the normality test, the non-parametric Mann Whitney U test is used. The purpose of these tests is to determine whether there exists a significant difference between the two age groups.
